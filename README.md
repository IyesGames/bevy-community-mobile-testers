# Bevy Community Mobile Testers

This is an effort to create a list of mobile hardware that active Bevy
community members have available to test Bevy on.

If Bevy developers would like something to be tested on specific hardware,
this list could serve as a reference for who could be contacted.

Let's make Bevy's mobile support awesome, together!

If you would like to be included, make a PR adding your GitHub and/or
Discord username. If your device is not listed, add it.

Please take responsibility to create PRs for updating or removing your
information if your circumstances change.
