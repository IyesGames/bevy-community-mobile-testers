# Bevy Community Mobile Testers

This is an effort to create a list of mobile hardware that active Bevy
community members have available to test Bevy on.

If Bevy engine developers would like something to be tested on specific
hardware, this list could serve as a reference for who could be contacted.

Note: this is for development of Bevy itself (you could be asked to run
one of the examples, or try a specific Pull Request). This is **not** about
running random people's projects on your phone!

Let's make Bevy's mobile support awesome, together!

If you would like to be included, make a PR adding your GitHub and/or
Discord username. If your device is not listed, add it.

Please take responsibility to create PRs for updating or removing your
information if your circumstances change.
